# have a look at the first 4 images, stored in the `images` attribute of the
# dataset.  If we were working from image files, we could load them using
# matplotlib.pyplot.imread.  Note that each image must have the same size. For these
# images, we know which digit they represent: it is given in the 'target' of
# the dataset.
